                            I used to play rugby in highschool and the love for the sport never went away. It taught me to be humble, how to be a good team player and to get up after every knock down. That getting pushed back does not mean you going to stay there. Most importantly it taught me that the work you put in gets reflected in the results at the end of the day.
